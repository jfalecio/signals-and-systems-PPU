# Compiled MATLAB Applications - Executables

This directory contains standalone Windows executables (.exe files) for all interactive MATLAB applications. These executables can run **without MATLAB installed**, requiring only the free MATLAB Runtime.

## Quick Start

1. **Install MATLAB Runtime** (see [Installation](#installation) below)
2. Navigate to the application you want to run (organized by lecture number)
3. Double-click the `.exe` file to launch the application

## Directory Structure

The executables are organized in the same structure as the source code:

```
Executables/Interactive Matlab Apps/
├── lec01/                    # Signal fundamentals applications
├── lec02/                    # Signal properties applications
├── lec04/                    # Discrete-time convolution
│   └── Discrete Time Convolution/
├── lec05/                    # Continuous-time convolution
│   └── Continuous Time Convolution/
└── lec07/                    # Fourier series and spectral analysis
    ├── FourierSeriesApp/
    ├── DTFourierSeriesApp/
    ├── BuildABeatSynthesizer/
    └── DutyCycleSpectrumAnalyzer/
```

## Installation

### MATLAB Runtime

The MATLAB Runtime is a free set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications. **You do not need a MATLAB license to use the runtime.**

#### Step 1: Determine Required Version

Each executable directory contains a `readme.txt` file that specifies the exact MATLAB Runtime version required. Open the `readme.txt` file in any executable directory to see the version number.

**Example**: If `readme.txt` says "MATLAB Runtime R2023b", you need to install MATLAB Runtime R2023b.

#### Step 2: Download MATLAB Runtime

1. Visit the [MATLAB Runtime download page](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)
2. Select the version specified in the `readme.txt` file
3. Download the installer for Windows (64-bit)

#### Step 3: Install MATLAB Runtime

1. Run the downloaded installer
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Accept the license agreement
4. Choose installation location (default is recommended)
5. Complete the installation

**Note**: The MATLAB Runtime installation is a one-time process. Once installed, all executables using that runtime version will work.

## About readme.txt Files

Each executable directory contains a `readme.txt` file automatically generated by the MATLAB Compiler. These files provide essential information:

### Contents of readme.txt

- **MATLAB Runtime Version**: The exact version required to run the executable
- **System Requirements**: Minimum system specifications
- **Installation Instructions**: Step-by-step guide for installing the MATLAB Runtime
- **Included Toolboxes**: List of MATLAB toolboxes included in the compilation
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Why readme.txt is Important

The `readme.txt` file is your primary reference for:
- Knowing which MATLAB Runtime version to install
- Understanding system requirements
- Getting installation help
- Troubleshooting runtime issues

**Always check the `readme.txt` file** in the executable directory before running an application for the first time.

## Running Applications

### Basic Usage

1. Ensure MATLAB Runtime is installed (see [Installation](#installation))
2. Navigate to the desired application directory
3. Double-click the `.exe` file
4. The application GUI will launch

### Example: Running a Lecture 1 Application

```
1. Navigate to: Executables/Interactive Matlab Apps/lec01/
2. Double-click: interactive_pure_tone_generator.exe
3. The application window opens
```

### Example: Running a Multi-File Application

For applications in subdirectories (like convolution visualizers):

```
1. Navigate to: Executables/Interactive Matlab Apps/lec04/Discrete Time Convolution/
2. Double-click: DT_main.exe
3. The application window opens
```

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- **RAM**: 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: 
  - MATLAB Runtime: ~1-2 GB (depending on version)
  - Executables: ~50-100 MB per application
- **Graphics**: Support for modern graphics (for GUI applications)

### Recommended Requirements

- **RAM**: 8 GB or more
- **Processor**: Multi-core processor
- **Graphics**: Dedicated graphics card (for better performance with visualizations)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "MATLAB Runtime not found" Error

**Problem**: The executable cannot find the MATLAB Runtime.

**Solutions**:
- Verify MATLAB Runtime is installed: Check "Add or Remove Programs" in Windows Settings
- Verify correct version: Check `readme.txt` for required version
- Reinstall MATLAB Runtime if needed
- Ensure runtime is in system PATH (usually automatic)

#### 2. Application Won't Start

**Problem**: Double-clicking the .exe does nothing or shows an error.

**Solutions**:
- Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed error messages
- Verify all files are present in the executable directory
- Try running from Command Prompt to see error messages:
  ```
  cd "Executables\Interactive Matlab Apps\lec01"
  interactive_pure_tone_generator.exe
  ```
- Check antivirus software isn't blocking the executable

#### 3. "Missing DLL" or "Missing Library" Errors

**Problem**: Error messages about missing dynamic link libraries.

**Solutions**:
- Reinstall MATLAB Runtime
- Install Visual C++ Redistributables (usually included with runtime)
- Check Windows Updates

#### 4. GUI Not Displaying Properly

**Problem**: Application window appears but graphics are missing or distorted.

**Solutions**:
- Update graphics drivers
- Check display scaling settings (try 100% scaling)
- Run as administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)

#### 5. Application Runs Slowly

**Problem**: Application is sluggish or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Check system resources (Task Manager)
- Update graphics drivers
- Ensure sufficient RAM (8 GB+ recommended)

### Getting More Help

1. **Check readme.txt**: Each executable directory has a `readme.txt` with specific information
2. **Check Application Logs**: Some applications may create log files
3. **MATLAB Runtime Documentation**: See [MathWorks Runtime Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/)
4. **System Requirements**: Verify your system meets minimum requirements
