# Signals and Systems - PPU

A Signals and Systems course repository containing LaTeX lecture notes, interactive MATLAB applications, and solved examples.

## Overview

This repository contains complete course materials for a Signals and Systems course, including:

-   **LaTeX lecture series** covering topics from basic signal definitions through advanced frequency-domain analysis
-   **Interactive MATLAB applications** for hands-on learning and visualization
-   **Solved examples** providing additional practice problems and worked solutions

All lectures are written in LaTeX with TikZ/PGFPlots figures for high-quality mathematical typesetting and visualizations.

## Quick Start

### Lectures

See the [Lectures/README.md](Lectures/README.md) for detailed instructions on compiling and using the lecture notes.

### MATLAB Applications

Interactive MATLAB applications are organized by lecture in the `Interactive Matlab Apps/` directory. Each application is designed to demonstrate key concepts from the corresponding lecture. Applications include interactive signal generators, convolution simulators, Fourier series analyzers, and spectral analysis tools.

See the [Interactive Matlab Apps/README.md](Interactive%20Matlab%20Apps/README.md) for detailed information about available applications and usage instructions.

### Solved Examples

Worked examples and practice problems are provided in the `Solved Examples/` directory, organized by lecture number. Each example file includes step-by-step solutions with accompanying figures.

See the [Solved Examples/README.md](Solved%20Examples/README.md) for compilation instructions and content overview.

## Compiled Executables

Standalone Windows executables (.exe files) are available in the `Executables/` directory. These executables can run without MATLAB installed, requiring only the MATLAB Runtime.

### Quick Start with Executables

1. **Install MATLAB Runtime** (if not already installed):
   - Download MATLAB Runtime from [MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)
   - Install the version corresponding to the MATLAB version used to compile the apps
   - The required MATLAB Runtime version is specified in the `readme.txt` files included with each executable

2. **Run an Executable**:
   - Navigate to `Executables/Interactive Matlab Apps/` 
   - Find the application you want to run (organized by lecture number)
   - Double-click the `.exe` file to launch the application

3. **Read the Documentation**:
   - Each executable directory contains a `readme.txt` file with runtime requirements and usage information
   - See [Executables/README.md](Executables/README.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting

### About readme.txt Files

The MATLAB Compiler automatically generates `readme.txt` files for each compiled application. These files contain:
- Required MATLAB Runtime version
- System requirements
- Installation instructions for the MATLAB Runtime
- Information about included toolboxes and dependencies

**Important**: You must install the MATLAB Runtime before running any executable. The runtime is free and does not require a MATLAB license.

For more information, see the [Executables/README.md](Executables/README.md) file.
