# Signals and Systems - PPU

A comprehensive Signals and Systems course repository containing LaTeX lecture notes, interactive MATLAB applications, and auxiliary examples.

## Overview

This repository contains complete course materials for a Signals and Systems course, including:
- **LaTeX lecture series** covering topics from basic signal definitions through advanced frequency-domain analysis
- **Interactive MATLAB applications** for hands-on learning and visualization
- **Auxiliary examples** providing additional practice problems and demonstrations

All lectures are written in LaTeX with TikZ/PGFPlots figures for high-quality mathematical typesetting and visualizations.
