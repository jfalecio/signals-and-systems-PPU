# Interactive MATLAB Applications

This directory contains interactive MATLAB applications designed to complement the Signals and Systems lecture series. Each application provides hands-on visualization and experimentation tools for key concepts covered in the course.

## Overview

The applications are organized by lecture number, with each subdirectory containing MATLAB scripts and applications relevant to that lecture's topics. Applications range from simple interactive demonstrations to comprehensive visualization tools with graphical user interfaces.

## Requirements

### For Running Source Code in MATLAB

- MATLAB R2023b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for some applications)
- Audio System Toolbox (for audio-related applications)

### For Running Compiled Executables

- **MATLAB Runtime** (free, no MATLAB license required)
  - Download from [MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)
  - Install the version specified in the `readme.txt` file included with each executable
  - The MATLAB Runtime is a standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications

**Note**: Each compiled executable includes a `readme.txt` file in the `Executables/` directory that specifies the exact MATLAB Runtime version required. See [Executables/README.md](../Executables/README.md) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

### Running Compiled Executables (Recommended for Users Without MATLAB)

Standalone Windows executables (.exe files) are available in the `Executables/Interactive Matlab Apps/` directory. These can run without MATLAB installed:

1. **Install MATLAB Runtime** (see Requirements above)
2. Navigate to `Executables/Interactive Matlab Apps/` 
3. Find the application by lecture number
4. Double-click the `.exe` file to launch

Each executable directory contains a `readme.txt` file with:
- Required MATLAB Runtime version
- System requirements
- Installation instructions
- Information about included toolboxes

For more details, see [Executables/README.md](../Executables/README.md).

### Running Source Code in MATLAB

### Running Applications

Most applications can be run directly by executing the main script file in MATLAB:

```matlab
% Navigate to the application directory
cd 'Interactive Matlab Apps/lec01'

% Run the application
interactive_pure_tone_generator
```

For applications with multiple files, see the README in each subdirectory for specific instructions.

### Application Types

1. **Interactive Scripts**: Simple MATLAB scripts with GUI interfaces
   - Run directly from MATLAB command window
   - Provide real-time parameter adjustment
   - Include visualization and audio playback

2. **Class-Based Applications**: Object-oriented MATLAB applications
   - Comprehensive GUI with multiple panels
   - Step-by-step animation controls
   - Export and analysis capabilities

3. **Simulink Models**: System-level simulations
   - Open in Simulink
   - Configure parameters through model interface
