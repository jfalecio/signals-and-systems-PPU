\section*{17.1 Introduction}

Over the past several weeks, we have developed a complete set of tools for transforming signals from the time domain to the frequency domain. We have the Fourier Series for periodic signals and the Fourier Transform for aperiodic signals, in both continuous and discrete time.

Today, we begin our deeper dive into the relationship between the time and frequency domains. We know that the Fourier transform, $X(j\omega)$, is a complex-valued function. We will now explore the significance of its \textbf{magnitude} and \textbf{phase} and what each part tells us about the original signal.

\subsection*{17.1.1 The Magnitude and Phase of the Fourier Transform}

The Fourier transform $X(j\omega)$ is a complex function of frequency, $\omega$. Just like any complex number, it can be represented in two principal forms:

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Rectangular Form:}
	\[
	X(j\omega) = \operatorname{Re}\{X(j\omega)\} + j\operatorname{Im}\{X(j\omega)\}
	\]
	This form is often mathematically convenient for derivations.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Polar Form:}
	\[
	X(j\omega) = |X(j\omega)|e^{j\angle X(j\omega)}
	\]
	This form is far more useful for building intuition.
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{$|X(j\omega)|$} is the \textbf{magnitude} of the Fourier transform. It tells us "how much" of the frequency component $\omega$ is present in the signal. It is a non-negative, real function.
	\item \textbf{$\angle X(j\omega)$} is the \textbf{phase} of the Fourier transform. It tells us "how the different frequency components align in time" to create the signal's shape. It represents the relative time shift of each sinusoidal component. It is a real-valued function.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mathematical Relationships:}
\begin{align}
|X(j\omega)| &= \sqrt{\operatorname{Re}\{X(j\omega)\}^2 + \operatorname{Im}\{X(j\omega)\}^2} \\
\angle X(j\omega) &= \operatorname{atan2}(\operatorname{Im}\{X(j\omega)\}, \operatorname{Re}\{X(j\omega)\})
\end{align}

For real-valued time signals $x(t)$, we know that $X(j\omega)$ is conjugate symmetric. This means:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item The magnitude $|X(j\omega)|$ is an \textbf{even function}: $|X(-j\omega)| = |X(j\omega)|$
	\item The phase $\angle X(j\omega)$ is an \textbf{odd function}: $\angle X(-j\omega) = -\angle X(j\omega)$
\end{itemize}

\section*{17.2 The Role of Magnitude and Phase}

The relative importance of magnitude and phase depends heavily on the application and the type of signal.

Consider a signal $x(t)$ and its Fourier transform $X(j\omega) = |X(j\omega)|e^{j\angle X(j\omega)}$.

Let's see what happens if we change the magnitude but keep the phase, and vice-versa:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Altering the Magnitude:} If we modify the magnitude to create a new spectrum $Y(j\omega) = |Y(j\omega)|e^{j\angle X(j\omega)}$, the resulting time signal $y(t)$ will have its frequency content changed, but the alignment and general location of features will be preserved.
	\item \textbf{Altering the Phase:} If we modify the phase to create a new spectrum $Z(j\omega) = |X(j\omega)|e^{j\angle Z(j\omega)}$, the resulting time signal $z(t)$ will have the same frequency content (the same power at each frequency), but the temporal structure can be completely destroyed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
	For many types of signals, particularly images and other signals where the temporal or spatial structure is critical, \textbf{the phase information is often more important than the magnitude information.} This principle was famously demonstrated by Oppenheim and Lim (1981) in their classic experiment where swapping the magnitude and phase spectra of two different images showed that the reconstructed image follows the phase, not the magnitude.
\end{remark}

\subsection*{17.2.1 Simple Example}

Consider a signal constructed from two cosines:
\[
x(t) = \cos(\omega_1 t) + \cos(\omega_2 t + \phi)
\]

The Fourier transform is:
\[
X(j\omega) = \pi[\delta(\omega - \omega_1) + \delta(\omega + \omega_1)] + \pi[e^{j\phi}\delta(\omega - \omega_2) + e^{-j\phi}\delta(\omega + \omega_2)]
\]

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{figures/lec17/fig_two_cosines_phase.tex}
	\caption{Effect of phase on signal shape: same magnitude spectrum, different time waveforms.}
	\label{fig:two_cosines_phase}
\end{figure}

Notice that:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item The magnitude spectrum $|X(j\omega)|$ is identical regardless of the phase $\phi$
	\item The time-domain waveform changes dramatically as $\phi$ varies
	\item This demonstrates that phase alignment determines waveform shape
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section*{17.3 Phase Discontinuities and Unwrapping}

When working with phase in both continuous-time and discrete-time Fourier transforms, we encounter the issue of phase wrapping. The raw phase is typically computed modulo $2\pi$, resulting in discontinuities.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Phase Unwrapping:} The process of removing $2\pi$ discontinuities to create a continuous phase function. This applies to both CTFT ($X(j\omega)$) and DTFT ($X(e^{j\omega})$) phase representations.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{figures/lec17/fig_phase_unwrapping.tex}
	\caption{Wrapped vs. unwrapped phase for a complex signal.}
	\label{fig:phase_unwrapping}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Key Points:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Occurs in both CT and DT:} Phase wrapping and discontinuities occur in both continuous-time ($X(j\omega)$) and discrete-time ($X(e^{j\omega})$) Fourier transforms
	\item The phase plot often shows discontinuities of $2\pi$ due to "phase wrapping" (artifacts of the $\operatorname{atan2}$ function)
	\item Phase becomes ill-defined or numerically unstable at frequencies where the magnitude is zero (for CTFT: $|X(j\omega)| = 0$; for DTFT: $|X(e^{j\omega})| = 0$)
	\item Phase unwrapping is the process of removing the $2\pi$ jumps to reveal the continuous underlying phase
	\item Phase unwrapping is essential for computing derivatives (group delay: $\tau_g(\omega) = -\frac{d}{d\omega}\{\angle H(j\omega)\}$ for CTFT, or $\tau_g(\omega) = -\frac{d}{d\omega}\{\angle H(e^{j\omega})\}$ for DTFT)
	\item The unwrapped phase should be continuous and differentiable
\end{itemize}

\section*{17.4 Frequency Response}

The concepts of magnitude and phase extend naturally to LTI systems through the frequency response $H(j\omega)$.

\begin{definition}
	For an LTI system with impulse response $h(t)$, the \textbf{frequency response} is:
	\[
	H(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t) e^{-j\omega t} \dd t
	\]
\end{definition}

The frequency response can also be written in polar form:
\[
H(j\omega) = |H(j\omega)|e^{j\angle H(j\omega)}
\]

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{$|H(j\omega)|$} controls amplitude versus frequency (filtering characteristics)
	\item \textbf{$\angle H(j\omega)$} controls timing alignment (phase distortion)
\end{itemize}
\section*{Summary and Next Lecture}
