		\item The phase response, $\angle H(j\omega)$, introduces a phase shift at each frequency
		\item A linear phase response is ideal, corresponding to a simple time delay without distortion
		\item A non-linear phase leads to non-constant group delay, causing phase distortion

\section*{19.1 Ideal Frequency-Selective Filters}

An \textbf{ideal filter} perfectly passes certain frequencies and completely rejects all others, without phase distortion. Two essential characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item $|H(j\omega)|$ is 1 in the passband and 0 in the stopband
	\item Linear phase response: $\angle H(j\omega) = -\alpha\omega$
\end{enumerate}

The impulse response $h(t)$ is obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response.

For an ideal lowpass filter with cutoff frequency $\omega_c$ and zero phase ($\alpha=0$):
\[
H(j\omega) = \begin{cases} 
1, & |\omega| < \omega_c \\ 
0, & |\omega| > \omega_c 
\end{cases}
\]

\end{figure}

\section*{19.2 Time-Domain Properties of Ideal Filters}

Using the duality property of the Fourier transform, a rectangular spectrum corresponds to a sinc-shaped impulse response:
\[
h(t) = \frac{\sin(\omega_c t)}{\pi t}
\]

This impulse response has two critical problems:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Non-causality:} The sinc function is non-zero for $t<0$, requiring the system to respond before the input is applied. Therefore, \textbf{ideal filters are not physically realizable} for real-time applications.
	\item \textbf{Infinite Duration:} The impulse response contains oscillations that decay slowly and extend infinitely in time.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{19.3 Non-Ideal, Practical Filters}

Practical filters must approximate ideal behavior.

Non-ideal filters have three frequency regions:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Passband:} Frequencies passed with minimal attenuation, typically allowing small ripple (e.g., within 1\%)
	\item \textbf{Stopband:} Frequencies significantly attenuated, with specified maximum ripple (e.g., less than 0.1\% of passband gain)
	\item \textbf{Transition Band:} The region between passband and stopband where the filter's gain transitions
\end{itemize}

	\input{figures/lec19/fig_filter_regions.tex}
	\caption{Filter frequency regions}
	\label{fig:filter_regions}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Fundamental Trade-off:}
A fundamental trade-off exists between frequency-domain and time-domain performance:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Sharper frequency cutoffs} (narrower transition bands) produce \textbf{increased overshoot} in the time domain
	\item \textbf{Wider transition bands} (smoother frequency cutoffs) produce less overshoot in the time domain.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
Interactive filter design tools demonstrate how narrowing the transition band increases step response overshoot.

\section*{19.4 Analog vs. Digital Implementation}

\subsection*{19.4.1 Analog Filter Advantages}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Zero latency:} No computational delay in processing
	\item \textbf{High speed:} Operation at MHz frequencies with simple op-amp circuits
	\item \textbf{Large dynamic range:} Both amplitude (10 million:1) and frequency (seven decades simultaneously)
	\item \textbf{Real-time operation:} Natural parallel processing of all frequency components
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{19.4.2 Digital Filter Advantages}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Precise specifications:} Exact filter coefficients without component tolerances
	\item \textbf{Stability:} Performance independent of temperature and aging
	\item \textbf{Flexibility:} Software-based design enables easy modification
	\item \textbf{Better frequency response:} Better passband flatness and stopband rejection
\end{itemize}

Digital filters exhibit inherent latency due to analog-to-digital conversion and processing delays.

\section*{19.5 The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)}

While the DTFT provides a complete frequency-domain representation for discrete-time signals, it is defined for signals of infinite duration and produces a continuous function of frequency. For practical computation, we need a finite-length, discrete-frequency representation: the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)}.

\subsection*{19.5.1 From DTFT to DFT}

Consider a finite-length sequence $x[n]$ of length $N$ (i.e., $x[n] = 0$ for $n < 0$ and $n \geq N$). The DTFT of this sequence is:
\[
X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]e^{-j\omega n}
\]

The DFT samples this continuous DTFT at $N$ equally spaced frequencies:
\[
\omega_k = \frac{2\pi k}{N}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, N-1
\]

\begin{definition}
	For a finite-length sequence $x[n]$ of length $N$, the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)} is:
	\[
	X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]e^{-j\frac{2\pi kn}{N}}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, N-1
	\]
	The \textbf{Inverse DFT (IDFT)} is:
	\[
	x[n] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k]e^{j\frac{2\pi kn}{N}}, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, N-1
	\]
\end{definition}

\subsection*{19.5.2 Key Properties of the DFT}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Finite Length:} Both time and frequency domains are finite and discrete
	\item \textbf{Periodicity:} The DFT implicitly treats $x[n]$ as one period of a periodic sequence
	\item \textbf{Relationship to DTFT:} $X[k] = X(e^{j\omega})|_{\omega = 2\pi k/N}$ - the DFT samples the DTFT
	\item \textbf{Computational Efficiency:} The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm computes the DFT in $O(N \log N)$ operations instead of $O(N^2)$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{19.5.3 Relationship to DTFS}

The DFT is essentially the same as the Discrete-Time Fourier Series (DTFS) coefficients for a periodic signal. If we view $x[n]$ as one period of a periodic sequence $\tilde{x}[n]$, then:
\[
X[k] = N \cdot a_k
\]
where $a_k$ are the DTFS coefficients of $\tilde{x}[n]$.

\begin{remark}
	The DFT provides a complete, computable representation for finite-length sequences. The FFT algorithm makes DFT computation efficient for large $N$, enabling real-time signal processing applications.
\end{remark}
