\section*{8.1 Introduction}

Last time, we established that complex exponentials are \textbf{eigenfunctions} of LTI systems, meaning that an input $e^{j\omega t}$ produces the output $H(j\omega)e^{j\omega t}$. This motivated the \textbf{Continuous-Time Fourier Series}, which represents a periodic signal $x(t)$ as a sum of harmonically related complex exponentials.

Today, we will examine the properties of this representation. We will explore how operations in the time domain (like shifting or differentiating a signal) affect its frequency-domain representation (the coefficients $a_k$). These properties are not just mathematical curiosities; they are powerful tools that provide deep insight and serve as computational shortcuts.

\section*{8.2 CTFS Properties}
	
	For convenience, we will use the notation $x(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_k$ to denote the pairing of a periodic signal with its Fourier series coefficients.
	
	\subsection*{8.2.1 Linearity}
	
	If $x(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_k$ and $y(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} b_k$, then:
	\[
	Ax(t) + By(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} Aa_k + Bb_k
	\]

	\subsection*{8.2.2 Time Shifting}
	
	\[
	x(t - t_0) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_k e^{-jk\omega_0 t_0}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Note:} Shifting a signal in time does \textbf{not} change the magnitude of its frequency components, $|a_k|$. It only introduces a \textbf{phase shift}, $-k\omega_0 t_0$, to each coefficient. This phase shift is linear with the harmonic number $k$.
	
	\begin{proof}
		Starting with the synthesis equation for $x(t)$:
		\[
		x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k e^{jk\omega_0 t}
		\]
		For the shifted signal $x(t - t_0)$:
		\[
		x(t - t_0) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k e^{jk\omega_0 (t - t_0)} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k e^{-jk\omega_0 t_0} e^{jk\omega_0 t}
		\]
		Therefore, the coefficients for $x(t - t_0)$ are $a_k e^{-jk\omega_0 t_0}$.
		
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{8.2.3 Time Reversal}
	
	\[
	x(-t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_{-k}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Note:} Reversing a signal in time also reverses its frequency spectrum.
	
	\textbf{Consequence:}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item If $x(t)$ is \textbf{even}, then $a_k$ are \textbf{even} ($a_k = a_{-k}$).
		\item If $x(t)$ is \textbf{odd}, then $a_k$ are \textbf{odd} ($a_k = -a_{-k}$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{8.2.4 Conjugation and Symmetry for Real Signals}
	
	For any \textbf{real} signal $x(t)$, the Fourier coefficients are \textbf{conjugate symmetric}:
	\[
	a_k = a_{-k}^*
	\]
	
	\begin{proof}
		For a real signal $x(t)$, we have $x(t) = x^*(t)$. Starting with the definition of $a_k^*$:
		\[
		a_k^* = \left( \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{T_0} x(t)e^{-jk\omega_0 t} \dd t \right)^* = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{T_0} x^*(t)e^{jk\omega_0 t} \dd t
		\]
		Since $x(t)$ is real, $x^*(t) = x(t)$, so:
		\[
		a_k^* = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{T_0} x(t)e^{jk\omega_0 t} \dd t = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{T_0} x(t)e^{-j(-k)\omega_0 t} \dd t = a_{-k}
		\]
		Therefore, $a_k = a_{-k}^*$ for real signals.
	\end{proof}
	
	\textbf{Consequences:}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item The magnitude is an \textbf{even} function: $|a_k| = |a_{-k}|$.
		\item The phase is an \textbf{odd} function: $\angle a_k = -\angle a_{-k}$.
		\item The DC component $a_0$ is real.
		\item If $x(t)$ is real and even, the coefficients $a_k$ are \textbf{real and even}.
		\item If $x(t)$ is real and odd, the coefficients $a_k$ are \textbf{purely imaginary and odd}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{remark}
		These are extremely useful. If you are given a real and even signal, you immediately know that you only need to compute the real-valued coefficients $a_k$ for $k \geq 0$, as the rest are determined by symmetry. This can cut the work in half.
	\end{remark}
	
	\subsection*{8.2.5 Parseval's Theorem for Periodic Signals}
	
	This property relates the average power in the time domain to the power in the frequency domain as follows:
	\[
	\frac{1}{T_0} \int_{T_0} |x(t)|^2 \dd t = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} |a_k|^2
	\]
	The total average power of a signal is the sum of the average powers of all its harmonic components. This shows that the \textbf{average power} is conserved between the time and frequency domains.
	
	The term $|a_k|^2$ is the average power in the $k^{th}$ harmonic. A plot of $|a_k|^2$ versus frequency is called the signal's \textbf{power spectrum}.
	
	\begin{proof}
		Starting with the integral for power:
		\[
		\frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0} x(t)x^*(t)\dd t = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0} x(t) \left( \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k^* e^{-jk\omega_0 t} \right) \dd t
		\]
		Swapping the sum and integral (assuming convergence):
		\[
		= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k^* \left( \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0} x(t)e^{-jk\omega_0 t} \dd t \right) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k^* a_k = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} |a_k|^2
		\]
		 
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{8.2.6 The Differentiation Property}
	
	\[
	\frac{\dd x(t)}{\dd t} \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} jk\omega_0 a_k
	\]
	
	\textbf{Note:} Differentiation is a \textbf{high-pass} operation. The $jk\omega_0$ factor amplifies the coefficients at higher frequencies (larger $k$) more than those at lower frequencies.
	
	\textbf{Physical Interpretation:} Derivatives measure the rate of change of a signal. Rapid changes (high frequencies) are emphasized, while slow changes (low frequencies) are attenuated. This is why differentiation acts as a high-pass filter - it naturally emphasizes the high-frequency content of signals.
	
	\begin{proof}
		Differentiating the synthesis equation:
		\[
		\frac{\dd x(t)}{\dd t} = \frac{\dd}{\dd t} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k e^{jk\omega_0 t} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k \frac{\dd}{\dd t} e^{jk\omega_0 t} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} jk\omega_0 a_k e^{jk\omega_0 t}
		\]
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{8.2.7 Integration Property}
	
	If $x(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_k$ and $a_0 = 0$, then:
	\[
	\int_{-\infty}^t x(\tau) \dd\tau \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} \frac{a_k}{jk\omega_0}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Note:} Integration is a \textbf{low-pass} (smoothing) operation. The $\frac{1}{jk\omega_0}$ factor attenuates higher frequencies more than lower frequencies.
	
	\textbf{Condition Explanation:} The condition $a_0 = 0$ (zero average value) is necessary because if it were non-zero, the integral $\int_{-\infty}^t x(\tau) \dd\tau$ would contain a term $a_0 t$, which grows with time and is not periodic. The Fourier Series can only represent periodic signals.
	
	\subsection*{8.2.8 Frequency Shifting (Modulation)}
	
	\[
	x(t) e^{jm\omega_0 t} \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_{k-m}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Note:} Multiplying a signal by a complex exponential shifts its entire frequency spectrum. This is the fundamental principle behind radio modulation, where a low-frequency signal (like voice) is shifted to a high-frequency band for transmission.
	
	\section*{8.3 Additional Properties and Relationships}
	
	\subsection*{8.3.1 Multiplication Property}
	
	The multiplication of two periodic signals in the time domain corresponds to convolution of their Fourier series coefficients in the frequency domain:
	\[
	x(t)y(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} (a * b)_k = \sum_{\ell=-\infty}^{\infty} a_\ell b_{k-\ell}
	\]
	
	This property is particularly useful for modulation and mixing operations in communications systems.
	
	\subsection*{8.3.2 Conjugation Property}
	
	For any signal $x(t)$:
	\[
	x^*(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_{-k}^*
	\]
	
	This property is useful for analyzing the frequency content of complex signals and for understanding the relationship between positive and negative frequency components.
	
	\subsection*{8.3.3 Time Scaling}
	
	For a time-scaled signal $x(at)$ where $a > 0$:
	\[
	x(at) \stackrel{\mathcal{FS}}{\longleftrightarrow} a_k \text{ with fundamental frequency } a\omega_0
	\]
	
	Time scaling compresses or expands the signal in time, which corresponds to expanding or compressing the frequency spectrum.

	\section*{8.4 Practical Applications of Properties}
	
	\subsection*{8.4.1 Finding the CTFS of a Triangular Wave}
	
	We can use the differentiation property to find the coefficients for a periodic triangular wave, $x(t)$, from the coefficients of a square wave, $g(t)$.
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\input{figures/lec08/fig_triangular_square_wave.tex}
		\caption{Triangular wave and its derivative (square wave)}
		\label{fig:triangular_square_wave}
	\end{figure}
	
	Let $x(t)$ be a triangular wave with period $T_0$ and amplitude $A$. The derivative $g(t) = \frac{\dd x(t)}{\dd t}$ is a square wave with amplitude equal to the slope of the triangular wave (e.g., $4A/T_0$ for a symmetric wave) and coefficients:
	\[
	b_k = \frac{4A}{T_0} D \cdot \text{sinc}(Dk)
	\]
	where $D$ is the duty cycle and $\text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}$.
	

	From the differentiation property: $b_k = jk\omega_0 a_k$
	
	For $k \neq 0$:
	\[
	a_k = \frac{b_k}{jk\omega_0} = \frac{\frac{4A}{T_0} D \cdot \text{sinc}(Dk)}{jk\omega_0} = \frac{4A D}{j2\pi k} \text{sinc}(Dk)
	\]
	
	The DC component $a_0$ is found by inspection (the average value of the triangular wave).

		\label{fig:differentiation_property_relationship}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{remark}
		\textbf{The smoother a signal is, the faster its Fourier series coefficients decay to zero.}
		
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item \textbf{Square Wave (Discontinuous):} The coefficients $b_k$ decay proportionally to $\frac{1}{k}$.
			\item \textbf{Triangular Wave (Continuous):} The coefficients $a_k$ contain an extra factor of $1/k$ from the integration, so they decay much faster, proportionally to $\frac{1}{k^2}$.
		\end{itemize}
		
		This faster decay means that a smooth signal like a triangular wave can be accurately approximated with fewer sinusoidal harmonics compared to a sharp, discontinuous signal like a square wave.

	\section*{8.5 Summary and Next Lecture}
	
	As we have demonstrated, the properties of the CTFS form a powerful 'dictionary' for translating operations between the time and frequency domains. These properties provide both computational shortcuts and deep physical insights into how signals behave.
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Time shifting introduces linear phase shifts proportional to frequency
		\item Differentiation acts as a high-pass filter, integration as a low-pass filter
		\item Real signals have conjugate-symmetric coefficients, reducing computation by half
		\item Parseval's relation shows energy conservation between time and frequency domains
		\item Properties provide powerful shortcuts for finding Fourier series coefficients
		\item \textbf{Next time:} We will develop the parallel representation for discrete-time periodic signals: the \textbf{Discrete-Time Fourier Series (DTFS)}. We will see many similarities, but also some critical differences that arise from the discrete nature of time.
